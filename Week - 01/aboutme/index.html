    <h2>Ezequiel Videla</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone!</p>
    <p>Nice to meet you! I'm Ezequiel, I'm 23 years old, and I'm from Buenos Aires, Argentina. 
    I served as a missionary in Brazil and also here in Argentina and I returned two years ago.</p>

    <p>Currently, I work as a freelance Full Stack Programmer, but my specialty is backend programming.
    I want to obtain a Bachelor's degree in Software Development to strengthen my foundations and expand my knowledge
    and I'm very glad for the opportunity that BYUI brings."</p>
